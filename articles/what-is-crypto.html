    <h1>What is Cryptocurrency? – A Beginner's Guide</h1>

    <p>
      <strong>Cryptocurrency</strong> is a type of digital currency that uses cryptography to secure transactions. It operates independently of traditional banking systems and is typically built on decentralized networks called blockchains.
    </p>

    <h2>1. The Birth of Crypto</h2>
    <p>
      The first and most well-known cryptocurrency is <strong>Bitcoin</strong>, launched in 2009 by an anonymous figure known as Satoshi Nakamoto. It was created in response to distrust in traditional financial institutions during the 2008 global financial crisis.
    </p>

    <h2>2. How Cryptocurrency Works</h2>
    <p>
      Most cryptocurrencies are powered by <strong>blockchain technology</strong>, a decentralized ledger that records all transactions transparently and securely. Transactions are verified by a network of computers called nodes.
    </p>

      <li><strong>Cold Wallets</strong>: Offline storage (e.g., USB hardware wallets)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Risks and Regulation</h2>
