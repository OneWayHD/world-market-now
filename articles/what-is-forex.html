    <h1>What is Forex? – A Beginner’s Guide to Foreign Exchange</h1>

    <p>
      The <strong>foreign exchange market</strong>, or <strong>forex (FX)</strong>, is the world’s largest financial market. It facilitates the exchange of currencies and operates 24 hours a day, five days a week.

    </ul>

    <h2>4. How Forex Trading Works</h2>
